# VariablesTypescript

Create a new app that does the following.

Practice Creating Variables

Create a variable that stores the numberOfCupsOfCoffee that you drink every day.
Create a variable called fullName and set it equal to your full name.
Use console.log and your variables, numberOfCupsOfCoffee and fullName to output all three on one line.
Create an variable that stores an object. Make the properties of the object fullName, luckyNumber , and favoriteMovies. Where fullname is your full name, luckyNumber is a number value of your favorite number, and favoriteMovies is an array of strings of a few of your top movies. NOTE: Try doing this using object literal: const aboutMe = { } and put the properties inside.
Practice Getting Input From the User

Using window.prompt, Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable named userName.
Use console.log to show a greeting to the user, using their name.
Converting String Input Into Numbers

Input two numbers from the user. Convert each resulting string from window.prompt to a number using Number. Save the first value in a variable named firstOperand and the second value in a variable named secondOperand.
Doing Math

Add the operand variables from above and save the results in a variable named sum.
Subtract the secondOperand variable from the firstOperand variable and save the results in a variable named difference.
Multiply the operand variables and save the results in a variable named product.
Divide the firstOperand by the secondOperand and save the results in a variable named quotient.
Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save the results in a variable named remainder.
Use console.log to present the user, in a meaningful way, each of the values for the sum, difference, quotient, product, and remainder variables. (e.g. perhaps one of your outputs is similar to If you add 4 and 5 you get 9 if 4 and 5 were the input)
Using Arrays

Use this page to generate an array of random numbers. NOTE: That format isn't ready for TypeScript. In your editor, you will need to format the collection of numbers as a TypeScript array.

Place these numbers into a properly formatted array named numbers.

Determine the following using one (or more) TypeScript for loops:

Find the smallest number in the array and place the answer in a variable named smallest
Find the largest number in the array and place the answer in a variable named largest
Find the sum of all the numbers in the array and place the answer in a variable named arraySum
Find the average of all the numbers in the array and place the answer in a variable named average
Create an object called stats with the following properties

In a property named smallest, put the value of the variable smallest
In a property named largest, put the value of the variable largest
In a property named sum, put the value of the variable arraySum
In a property named average, put the value of the variable average
